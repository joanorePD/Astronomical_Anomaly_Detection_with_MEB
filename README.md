# Optimization for Data Science Final Project

This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks related to the final project for the class "Optimization for Data Science". The primary focus is on solving the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem for anomaly detection and understanding the distribution of celestial objects in large datasets.

## Contents:

1. **alg_functions.py:**  
   Python script containing the implementations of optimization algorithms and other useful functions, including the Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants.

2. **dataset_1_rr_lyrae.ipynb:**  
   Jupyter notebook exploring and analyzing optimization algorithms on the first dataset related to RR Lyrae stars.

3. **dataset_2_dwarfs.ipynb:**  
   Jupyter notebook investigating optimization algorithms on the second dataset related to dwarf stars.

4. **dataset_3_quasar.ipynb:**  
   Jupyter notebook dedicated to the application of optimization algorithms on the third dataset related to quasars.

5. **line_search_tests.ipynb:**  
   Jupyter notebook conducting tests and analyses related to line search strategies within optimization algorithms.
